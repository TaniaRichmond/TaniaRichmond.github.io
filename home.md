Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of New-Caledonia

## Presentation

I am currently working as an associate professor in Computer Science at the University of New-Caledonia, in Noumea (New-Caledonia). 

Previously, I worked for the French Ministry of Armies at DGA-MI, in Bruz (France), from September 2020 to February 2023. I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Science from September 2017 to August 2020, in the TAMIS team of Inria Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique, at Univ Rennes, Inria, CNRS, IRISA, in Rennes (France). I was a Temporary Teaching and Research Assistant in Computer Science from October 2015 to August 2017, at the Computer Science and Applied Algebra group in the IMATH Laboratory, at the Toulon's University, in La Garde (France). I was a PhD student in Computer Science from October 2012 to October 2016 at the Embedded System Security and Hardware Architecture group in the Hubert Curien Laboratory, at the Jean Monnet University in Saint-Ã‰tienne (France), under the supervision of Viktor Fischer and Pierre-Louis Cayrel.

## PhD topic

*Secure implementation of cryptographic protocols based on error-correcting codes.*

Defended on October 24th, 2016, at the Hubert Curien Laboratory in Saint-Etienne, France. 

## PhD supervision

I was co-supervising a PhD student at IRISA, namely Agathe Cheriere, with Pierre Loidreau. She started her PhD thesis in November 2020 and defended it on December 19th, 2023 on the topic: *Side-channel resistance of cryptographic primitives based on error-correcting codes*.
