Researcher in Computer Science

## Presentation

I am currently working for the French Ministry of Armies at DGA-MI, in Bruz (France). I am co-supervising a PhD student at IRISA, namely Agathe Cheriere, with Annelie Heuser and Pierre Loidreau. She started in November 2020 on the topic: Side-channel resistance of cryptographic primitives based on error-correcting codes.

I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Science from September 2017 to August 2020, in the TAMIS team of Inria Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique, at Univ Rennes, Inria, CNRS, IRISA, in Rennes (France). 

Previously, I was a Temporary Teaching and Research Assistant in Computer Science from October 2015 to August 2017, at the Computer Science and Applied Algebra group in the IMATH Laboratory, at the Toulon's University, in La Garde (France).

I was a PhD student in Computer Science from October 2012 to October 2016 at the Embedded System Security and Hardware Architecture group in the Hubert Curien Laboratory, at the Jean Monnet University in Saint-Étienne (France), under the supervision of Viktor Fischer and Pierre-Louis Cayrel.

## PhD topic

Secure implementation of cryptographic protocols based on error-correcting codes.

Defended on October 24th, 2016, at the Hubert Curien Laboratory in Saint-Etienne, France.
